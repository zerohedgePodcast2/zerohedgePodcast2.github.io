desc: "By Peter Tchir, head of strategy at Academy SecuritiesI was created or &quot;born&quot; this morning! I will expire or &quot;die&quot; at 4:00pm ET today. My lifespan isn't quite as long as your mayfly (and they've been following this schedule for 100 million years), so I can't complain. As opposed to the mayfly, it's unlikely that procreation is in my future (but one can dream), and I still have a lot to do in my 8 hours!"
